To add these Java versions to `jenv` and make version 17 the global version, you can follow these steps:

1. **Add Java Versions to jenv:**

   Run the following commands to add the Java versions to `jenv`:

   ```bash
   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-20.jdk/Contents/Home
   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/amazon-corretto-8.jdk/Contents/Home
   ```

   This will add the Java versions you have installed to `jenv`.

2. **Set Java 17 as Global Version:**

   After adding the Java versions, you can set Java 17 as the global version by running:

   ```bash
   jenv global 17.0.10
   ```

   This command sets the global Java version to 17.0.10, making it the default version for all shells and applications.

3. **Verify the Global Version:**

   To verify that Java 17 is now set as the global version, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   jenv version
   ```

   This should display `17.0.10` as the current global Java version.
