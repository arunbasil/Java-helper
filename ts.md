Creating a comprehensive test plan involves several key phases and detailed steps to ensure all components and their integrations are thoroughly tested. Here’s a structured approach:

### Test Plan for Local Data Store with Kafka, Spring Boot API, and PostgreSQL

#### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Objective**: To test the local data store (LDS) that is updated by Kafka topics produced by the BIS system and consumed by a Spring Boot API.
   - **Scope**: The testing will cover the database setup, initial data hydration, and real-time updates.

#### 2. **Test Phases and Approaches**

##### **Phase 1: Database Testing**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the PostgreSQL database is correctly set up and can handle data operations.
   - **Approach**:
     1. **Environment Setup**:
        - Set up the PostgreSQL database.
        - Verify the database schema and tables are correctly created.
     2. **Test Cases**:
        - **Schema Validation**: Check that all tables, columns, data types, constraints, and indexes are as per the design specifications.
        - **CRUD Operations**: Manually insert, update, delete, and retrieve data to validate basic operations.
        - **Data Integrity**: Ensure data integrity rules are enforced, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.
        - **Performance Testing**: Test the database performance for basic operations.

##### **Phase 2: Spring Boot API and Kafka Integration Testing**
   - **Objective**: Validate the integration of the Spring Boot API with Kafka topics and the PostgreSQL database.
   - **Approach**:
     1. **Environment Setup**:
        - Deploy the Spring Boot API.
        - Set up Kafka topics and ensure they are correctly configured.
     2. **Initial Data Hydration**:
        - Produce sample Kafka messages for initial data hydration.
        - Validate that the Spring Boot API consumes these messages and correctly inserts data into the PostgreSQL database.
     3. **Real-time Updates**:
        - Produce Kafka messages for real-time updates to customer details.
        - Validate that the Spring Boot API processes these messages and updates the database accordingly.

   - **Test Cases**:
        - **Message Consumption**: Ensure the Spring Boot API correctly consumes Kafka messages.
        - **Data Insertion**: Verify that initial data from Kafka is correctly inserted into the database.
        - **Data Updates**: Validate that updates from Kafka messages are correctly reflected in the database.
        - **Error Handling**: Test how the system handles invalid or malformed Kafka messages.
        - **Performance Testing**: Measure the time taken for the API to process messages and update the database.

##### **Phase 3: End-to-End Testing**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the entire system works as expected from Kafka message production to database updates.
   - **Approach**:
     1. **Environment Setup**:
        - Ensure the entire setup is correctly deployed and configured.
     2. **Test Cases**:
        - **Full Workflow Validation**: Produce Kafka messages for various scenarios and validate the entire workflow.
        - **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency between the BIS system, Kafka, Spring Boot API, and PostgreSQL database.
        - **Concurrent Updates**: Test the system’s behavior with concurrent Kafka messages to ensure it handles high throughput.
        - **Failover and Recovery**: Test the system’s resilience to failures and its ability to recover gracefully.

##### **Phase 4: Regression Testing**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that changes and updates do not introduce new issues.
   - **Approach**:
     1. **Test Cases**:
        - **Re-run Critical Tests**: Re-execute critical test cases from all phases to ensure they still pass.
        - **Automation**: Automate regression tests for frequent execution.

#### 3. **Tools and Technologies**
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL
   - **API Framework**: Spring Boot
   - **Messaging**: Kafka
   - **Testing Tools**: JUnit, Mockito, Postman, Apache JMeter (for performance testing), and any database testing tools like DBeaver.

#### 4. **Test Deliverables**
   - **Test Plan Document**: This document.
   - **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases for each phase.
   - **Test Execution Report**: Reports from each test phase, including any defects found and their resolution.
   - **Automation Scripts**: Scripts for automated tests.

#### 5. **Risks and Mitigation**
   - **Integration Issues**: Thorough integration testing and having a dedicated environment for integration tests.
   - **Performance Bottlenecks**: Regular performance testing and optimizing the code and database queries.
   - **Data Inconsistency**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing and data validation.

#### 6. **Timeline and Milestones**
   - **Phase 1**: Database Testing - Week 1
   - **Phase 2**: Integration Testing - Week 2
   - **Phase 3**: End-to-End Testing - Week 3
   - **Phase 4**: Regression Testing - Week 4
