Here are some **positive** and **negative** test cases for the Kafka producer, considering that logs will be retained in Kafka for six weeks and then ingested into Snowflake.

### **Positive Test Cases:**

1. **Log Event Successfully Published to Kafka Topic**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka producer successfully publishes log events to the correct Kafka topic.
   - **Expected Result**: The log event is successfully published to the correct topic (`financial-crime.confirmation-of-payee.nameverification-request.log`, etc.).
   - **Scenario**: API returns a 200 OK response, and the producer successfully sends logs.

2. **Log Event Retained for Six Weeks**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that log events are retained in Kafka for six weeks.
   - **Expected Result**: Log events are stored in Kafka without being deleted or altered for the specified retention period (six weeks).
   - **Scenario**: The log event exists in Kafka even after six weeks, ready for ingestion into Snowflake.

3. **Successful Ingestion of Kafka Logs into Snowflake**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka log events are successfully ingested into Snowflake after six weeks.
   - **Expected Result**: Log events are correctly ingested into Snowflake tables without any data loss.
   - **Scenario**: Kafka logs are retained, and after six weeks, Snowflake ingests all events.

4. **Kafka Producer Handles Multiple Log Events**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka producer can handle and publish multiple log events simultaneously.
   - **Expected Result**: All log events are successfully published and retained for six weeks.
   - **Scenario**: Kafka producer publishes logs from multiple requests, all of which are stored for six weeks and ingested into Snowflake.

5. **Log Metadata is Accurate**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that log metadata (timestamp, message type, status code) is accurate when published to Kafka.
   - **Expected Result**: The metadata fields are correct, and they are retained in Kafka as expected.
   - **Scenario**: Kafka topics store logs with all necessary metadata for future ingestion.

### **Negative Test Cases:**

1. **Log Event Fails to Publish to Kafka Topic**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka producer handles failures when publishing log events to the Kafka topic.
   - **Expected Result**: An appropriate error is returned, and the event is retried or logged as failed without affecting the system.
   - **Scenario**: Simulate API failures (e.g., 4xx/5xx status codes) and check that no event is published.

2. **Log Event Not Retained in Kafka for Six Weeks**
   - **Test Case**: Verify what happens when log events are not retained for the required six-week period.
   - **Expected Result**: The system identifies the missing logs, raises alerts, and handles the failure appropriately.
   - **Scenario**: Force the Kafka topic to purge messages early and test the handling of missing data in Snowflake.

3. **Log Event Corrupted or Incomplete**
   - **Test Case**: Verify how the system handles a corrupted or incomplete log event in Kafka.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka discards or flags the corrupted event, and it is not ingested into Snowflake.
   - **Scenario**: A log event is published with incomplete data, causing ingestion into Snowflake to fail.

4. **Kafka Topic Reaches Storage Limit Before Six Weeks**
   - **Test Case**: Verify what happens when the Kafka topic reaches its storage limit before the six-week retention period.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka either purges old data or raises an alert, and the system should ensure no data is lost.
   - **Scenario**: Simulate reaching Kafkaâ€™s storage capacity and check whether logs are retained as required.

5. **Failure in Kafka-Snowflake Ingestion**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that ingestion into Snowflake fails due to a network or configuration error.
   - **Expected Result**: The ingestion process retries the operation or raises an alert, but no data is lost in Kafka.
   - **Scenario**: Simulate an ingestion failure into Snowflake and ensure Kafka logs are still available for future ingestion.

6. **Kafka Producer Sends Logs to Incorrect Topic**
   - **Test Case**: Verify the behavior when the Kafka producer sends log events to an incorrect Kafka topic.
   - **Expected Result**: The system raises an alert for incorrect log event routing, and logs are not ingested into Snowflake.
   - **Scenario**: Misconfiguration causes the producer to send logs to the wrong topic, and ingestion into Snowflake fails or logs are lost.

7. **Logs Not Published Due to Spring Boot Failure**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that if Spring Boot fails, logs are not published into Kafka.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka retains no logs for this event, and the system logs the failure.
   - **Scenario**: Simulate a failure in Spring Boot to see if log publication and subsequent Kafka retention are interrupted.

These test cases cover various scenarios involving Kafka producers, log retention, and Snowflake ingestion. They help ensure the system functions correctly under both normal and adverse conditions.

Kafka schema validation ensures that the structure of messages being produced and consumed in Kafka topics adheres to predefined schemas, typically using **Apache Avro** or other formats like **Protobuf** or **JSON Schema**. This ensures that data consistency is maintained between producers and consumers, which is particularly crucial when the data is later ingested into systems like Snowflake.

Here are **positive** and **negative** test cases for Kafka schema validation:

### **Positive Test Cases for Kafka Schema Validation:**

1. **Valid Avro Schema for Kafka Message**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka producer correctly serializes a message using a valid Avro schema.
   - **Expected Result**: The message is successfully published to Kafka, and the consumer can deserialize it using the same Avro schema.
   - **Scenario**: A message with all required fields (correct data types) adheres to the Avro schema and is retained in Kafka for later ingestion.

2. **Schema Evolution Handling**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that Kafka handles schema evolution when a new field is added to the schema.
   - **Expected Result**: The producer publishes messages with the new schema, and older consumers can still deserialize older versions without breaking.
   - **Scenario**: Add a non-mandatory field to the Avro schema and check if both new and old messages are handled correctly by Kafka and downstream systems like Snowflake.

3. **Backward Compatibility Validation**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that schema validation is backward compatible.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka producers using a newer version of the schema can publish messages that consumers with older versions of the schema can read without issues.
   - **Scenario**: Modify the schema with compatible changes (e.g., adding optional fields) and ensure successful validation on both producer and consumer ends.

4. **Kafka Schema Validation During Ingestion to Snowflake**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that Kafka messages are ingested into Snowflake only if they match the defined schema.
   - **Expected Result**: Snowflake successfully ingests valid Kafka messages, while invalid ones are flagged or discarded.
   - **Scenario**: Ensure that schema-validated Kafka messages are seamlessly ingested into Snowflake.

5. **Kafka Consumer Validates Schema During Deserialization**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka consumer successfully deserializes messages based on the schema.
   - **Expected Result**: The consumer is able to validate and deserialize the message using the Avro schema.
   - **Scenario**: Kafka consumer subscribes to a topic and deserializes messages using a schema registry without any errors.

### **Negative Test Cases for Kafka Schema Validation:**

1. **Schema Mismatch Between Producer and Consumer**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that Kafka produces an error when the producer and consumer use incompatible schemas.
   - **Expected Result**: The consumer fails to deserialize the message due to a schema mismatch, and an appropriate error is logged.
   - **Scenario**: Producer uses an updated schema, but the consumer uses an old one, leading to deserialization failure.

2. **Message Without Required Fields**
   - **Test Case**: Verify the behavior when a Kafka producer sends a message missing required fields according to the schema.
   - **Expected Result**: The message is rejected, or an error is logged during schema validation, and the message is not published to Kafka.
   - **Scenario**: The producer attempts to publish a message with missing required fields, leading to validation failure.

3. **Invalid Data Type in Kafka Message**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that schema validation fails when the message contains an invalid data type (e.g., string instead of integer).
   - **Expected Result**: The producer fails to publish the message, and an error is returned indicating schema validation failure.
   - **Scenario**: Send a message with an incorrect data type for one of the fields, and verify that it is rejected by Kafka due to schema mismatch.

4. **Schema Not Registered in Schema Registry**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that the Kafka producer cannot publish a message if the schema is not registered in the schema registry.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka throws an error, and the message is not published.
   - **Scenario**: Try to publish a message with a schema that has not been registered, leading to a validation error.

5. **Incompatible Changes to Schema**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that schema validation fails when an incompatible change (e.g., removing a required field or changing a field type) is made to the schema.
   - **Expected Result**: Kafka rejects the message because the new schema is incompatible with the old one.
   - **Scenario**: Make a backward-incompatible change to the schema (like removing required fields), and test that the Kafka producer fails to publish messages using the updated schema.

6. **Consumer Fails to Deserialize Message Due to Invalid Schema**
   - **Test Case**: Verify the behavior when a Kafka consumer tries to deserialize a message that does not match its expected schema.
   - **Expected Result**: The consumer fails to deserialize the message and throws an error, logging the issue.
   - **Scenario**: The producer sends a message with an invalid schema, and the consumer fails to process it.

7. **Schema Validation Fails During Ingestion into Snowflake**
   - **Test Case**: Verify that schema validation fails during ingestion into Snowflake when the Kafka message does not match the expected schema.
   - **Expected Result**: Snowflake rejects the invalid Kafka message, and an error is logged.
   - **Scenario**: A message with a mismatched schema is sent to Kafka, but during ingestion into Snowflake, it is rejected due to schema validation errors.

### **Additional Considerations:**
- **Integration with Schema Registry**: If you're using Confluent's Schema Registry, ensure that schema validation is enabled both at the producer and consumer ends. This helps enforce consistent schema usage across Kafka topics.
- **Schema Versioning**: Ensure that when schema evolution occurs, versioning is properly handled so that both old and new consumers can work with different schema versions without breaking compatibility.

These test cases ensure robust validation of schemas in Kafka, maintaining data consistency throughout the data pipeline, including Snowflake ingestion.
